# 2. How to use

## 2.1 Generate interferograms

Please see this [page](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/docs/isce_preprocessing.md) for help. 

***Note: to run the FSH software using the example interferograms we provide (see [test_example_ISCE_insarApp](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/docs/test_example_ISCE_insarApp.md), [test_example_ISCE_stripmapApp](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/docs/test_example_ISCE_stripmapApp.md), [test_example_ROIPAC](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/docs/test_example_ROIPAC.md)), please skip ahead to 2.2.***

## 2.2 Run the Forest Stand Height model

***We recommend to use the Python 3 scripts.***

***Note we have also provided the ALOS-2 support in the current release. Users would only need to follow the same instructions below for either ALOS-1 or ALOS-2 data. The scripts are wise enough to determine which sensor the data were acquired from and then do the FSH inversion and mosaicking.***

***For the examples, we provide an exact command on the respective page (see [test_example_ISCE_insarApp](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/docs/test_example_ISCE_insarApp.md), [test_example_ISCE_stripmapApp](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/docs/test_example_ISCE_stripmapApp.md), [test_example_ROIPAC](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/docs/test_example_ROIPAC.md))***

The scripts are organized so that they can be run at the command line by a single command, shown here:

	python forest_stand_height.py scenes edges start_scene iterations \
	link_file \
	flag_file \
	ref_file \
	mask_file \
	file_directory \
	output_file_types \
	[--Nd_pairwise] [--Nd_self] [--N_pairwise] [--N_self] [--bin_size] [--flag_sparse] \
	[--flag_diff] [--flag_error] [—numLooks] [—noiselevel] [--flag_proc] [--flag_grad] [--lat_shift] [--lon_shift]
	
The parameters listed in square brackets are optional. All other paramters require input.

Exact parameter definitions and full descriptions can be found in the [File Description](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/v1.3/docs/reference.md) section below.

The input files that need to be in file_directory are:

  - `flag_file` - a text file that lists all the flags and corresponding full file names and associated file information (dates, scene location (frame#, orbit#), polarization), e.g. 
  
        001 890_120_20070727_HV_20070911_HV 070727 070911 890 120 HV
        002 890_119_20070710_HV_20071010_HV 070710 071010 890 119 HV
        003 890_118_20070708_HV_20070923_HV 070708 070923 890 118 HV

	where frame# and orbit# need to be 3-digit interger for the current release.	

  - `ref_file` - reference tree height data (Lidar or field inventory) in raster format. Currently the code is set up to use a GeoTIFF file, but other reference data in raster format could potentially be used with some code adjustments. Margin/NoData values should be sent to NaN or some number less than zero. 	
	
  - `mask_file` - landcover mask that excludes all water areas and areas of human disturbance (urban, agriculture). Currently set up to be a GeoTIFF file. Other reference data in raster format could potentially be used with some code adjustments. File must be in degrees (i.e., EPSG 4326). This file is optional (although recommended to use). If unused input "`-`" in place of the file name for the command line arguments. Both the lidar data and the forest/non_forest mask are better to be resampled to the comparable (preferably the same) resolution as the InSAR image.
	
  - `link_file` - a text file that lists all the edge scene pairs. Each line consists of the two numbers that correspond to the flag numbers for those two scenes. (e.g. "`2 1`" would be the line for the edge of the above scenes 001 and 002). If using a single ALOS scene this file is unneeded, and input "`-`" instead of the file name for the command line arguments.	
	
  - `file_directory` - the root directory that consists of the individual scenes-directories. Each scene should have a directory named "`f$frame_o$orbit`" (e.g. “f890_o120” for the above scene 001). This directory will both contain the input ROI_PAC/ISCE files, as well be the output location for all files that are associated with only that scene.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each ISCE-processed scene, the following files should be located in a directory with the format "`f$frame_o$orbit/int_$date1_$date2`":
		
    *Proc.xml (insarProc.xml for insarApp and stripmapProc.xml for stripmapApp)	
    resampOnlyImage.amp.geo	
    resampOnlyImage.amp.geo.xml	
    topophase.cor.geo		
    topophase.cor.geo.xml
		
***Note: In the [ISCE_preprocessing_scripts](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/ISCE_processing_scripts), ISCE's insarApp.py or stripmapApp.py is set up to run with multiple looks in both coherence estimation and the final multi-looking of the products so that the multi-looked pixel is equivalent to a 30m-by-30m area on the ground (that is the SRTM DEM resolution). This corresponds to 2 range looks and 10 azimuth looks for ALOS, e.g. with the following lines added to the * Proc.xml file:***
		
    <property name="range looks">1</property>
    <property name="azimuth looks">5</property>
    
***and 4 range looks and 8 azimuth looks for ALOS-2, e.g. with the following lines added to the * Proc.xml file:***
		
    <property name="range looks">2</property>
    <property name="azimuth looks">4</property>

***Note: For coherence estimation, a 5-point triangle window is hardcoded in the [ISCE_preprocessing_scripts](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/ISCE_processing_scripts), which is equivalent to a 2-point rectangle window. That is why the number of looks in the above parameter setup is only half of the desired values. For final multi-looking of the products, the .amp/.cor images then still need to be multi-looked by a factor of 2 to match the desired number of looks that give the SRTM resolution. For users' convenience, all of the above parameter setup along with margin cropping, multi-looking and geocoding have already been included in the [ISCE_processing_scripts](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/ISCE_processing_scripts). For further details on running ISCE see the [ISCE manual](https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2).***


The location of the output files depends on whether they are related to the overall processing of the entire data set, or are directly associated with a single scene. Examples of each would be the SC iteration files as a general output, and a single forest stand height image as a scene-specific output. The general outputs will be stored in a directory named "output" located within the main file directory (`file_directory`). The scene specific outputs will be stored with the other scene data as described earlier.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is an an example run of the model using a three scene dataset (in the test example folders), consisting of a central scene with overlapping NASA's LVIS LiDAR data and two adjacent scenes. All five possible final output data types are produced. Runtimes are based off of running the model on a Macintosh 64-bit machine with 16GB RAM, and an Intel Core i7 @ 2.8 GHz processor.

A sample run is given below by referring to the directory containing all the python scripts:

- To run with ISCE-processed files as input:

      python <full_path_to_directory_of_scripts>forest_stand_height.py 3 2 2 5 \
      "linkfile.txt" \
      "flagfile.txt" \
      "Howland_LVIS_NaN.tif" \
      "Maine_NLCD2011_nonwildland.tif" \
      "<full_path_to_directory_of_test_example>" \
      "gif json kml mat tif" \
      --flag_proc=1

The scripts are also able to be run with a single radar scene. To do this use "`-`" instead of a link_file name, and in the input have 0 edges. 

- Example: 

      python <full_path_to_directory_of_scripts>forest_stand_height.py 1 0 1 5 \
      - \
      "flagfile.txt" \
      "Howland_LVIS_NaN.tif" \
      "Maine_NLCD2011_nonwildland.tif" \
      "<full_path_to_directory_of_test_example>" \
      "gif json kml mat tif" \
      --flag_proc=1

***Note: We use <> symbol as representation of a directory, don't type it as input. If the directory of scripts are added to the path and Python path environmental variables, it can be omitted.***

***Note: If the interferograms were produced using ROI_PAC, use --flag_proc=0 instead. Also see details on ROI_PAC processing [here](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/docs/roi_pac_note.md).***

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Runtimes***

This main script in turn calls seven other scripts with the total runtime around 23 minutes 22 secs for the test example of mosaicking three ALOS InSAR scenes:

- auto_tree_height_many() - extracts data from ROI_PAC/ISCE output files and formats them for use in the rest of the scripts (15 secs)

- intermediate() - calculates the overlap between each pair of images (12 mins 17 secs)

- auto_mosaicking_new() - runs iterations of mosaicking (~34 secs per iteration, or 2 mins 49 secs total)

- write_deltaSC() - calculates the temporal change parameters based on the final iteration (less than a second)

- write_mapfile_new() - calculates and writes the tree height map to a file (7 mins 55 secs)

- Use of --flag_diff calls write_diff_height_map() to produce the forest differential height map between the radar and overlapping lidar images (1 sec).

- Use of --flag_error calls cal_error_metric() to produce the error metric file that can be used for plotting figures (5 secs).

***Note: Runtime does not increase linearly with each additional scene. Runtime for most of the steps are linear in the number of scenes, however, the core part of the inversion & mosaicking depends on the number of edges, which increases a bit faster as the number of scenes increases.***



## 2.3 Generate the forest height mosaic map

***We recommend to use the Python 3 scripts.***

***For the examples, we provide an exact command on the respective page (see [test_example_ISCE_insarApp](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/docs/test_example_ISCE_insarApp.md), [test_example_ISCE_stripmapApp](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/docs/test_example_ISCE_stripmapApp.md), [test_example_ROIPAC](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/blob/dev/docs/test_example_ROIPAC.md))***

Run the following command to create the final mosaic map of FSH as a single GeoTiff file

    python create_mosaic.py directory mosaicfile 
	
    directory	-	the same root directory as forest_stand_height.py executes
    mosaicfile	-	file name of the final mosaic file
    
- Example: 

      python <full_path_to_directory_of_scripts>create_mosaic.py \
      "<full_path_to_directory_of_test_example>" "3sc_mosaic.tif"

***Note: We use <> symbol as representation of a directory, don't type it as input. If the directory of scripts are added to the path and Python path environmental variables, it can be omitted.***

***Note: create_mosaic.py was edited to make data processing more convenient using the example data. It will search the working directory for folders starting with 'f' (i.e. as thosed used in the example). It will then iterate through those folders and pick out any files ending in 'fsh.tif' and mosaick them together. Adjust as needed.***
