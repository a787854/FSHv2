	  outtype (string) - string to signify which input (tree height “stand_height” or differential height “diff_height”) is being output

	  filename (string) - scene file name

	  directory (string) - directory path of where the input and output files are located

	  filetype (string) - file extension for the desired output file type (.gif, .json, .kml, .mat, and .tif accepted -> input without the "." (e.g. "kml" instead of ".kml")
	  
	  coords (numpy array) - array of max lat and lon values in the format [north, south, west, east]
	
	  reffile (string) - reference filename containing ground truth data (optional - only needed for differential height map)

Output:
	
  	output files(s) of the array image saved in the file type specified in the input


-------------------------------------------------------------


### write_mapfile_new.py - Makes the tree height map and writes it to an file

Input:
	
	  scenes (int) - number of scenes in the data set

	  flagfile (string) - file name of the file that lists all the scene flags and corresponding full file names and associated file date (dates, scene location (frame#,orbit#), polarization)

	  maskfile (string) - filename of the mask file that excludes all non-forest areas (mask excluding water and human disturbed areas such as urban and agriculture is also acceptable) (optional - if no mask available use '-' as an input to forest_stand_height.py)

	  directory (string) - directory path of where the input and output files are located

	  output_files (string) - list of the desired output file types formatted as a single string (e.g. "kml json tif")

	  scenename_orig.mat: correlation map and associated parameters for the central scene (generated in previous steps)

	  scenename_tempD.json: delta S and C files produced (generated in previous steps)

Output: no direct output (all file output created in write_file_type.py)
